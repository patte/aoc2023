how can this problem be described mathematically?

You pull out your handy Oasis And Sand Instability Sensor and analyze your surroundings. The OASIS produces a report of many values and how they are changing over time (your puzzle input). Each line in the report contains the history of a single value. For example:

0 3 6 9 12 15
1 3 6 10 15 21
10 13 16 21 30 45

To best protect the oasis, your environmental report should include a prediction of the next value in each history. To do this, start by making a new sequence from the difference at each step of your history. If that sequence is not all zeroes, repeat this process, using the sequence you just generated as the input sequence. Once all of the values in your latest sequence are zeroes, you can extrapolate what the next value of the original history should be.

In the above dataset, the first history is 0 3 6 9 12 15. Because the values increase by 3 each step, the first sequence of differences that you generate will be 3 3 3 3 3. Note that this sequence has one fewer value than the input sequence because at each step it considers two numbers from the input. Since these values aren't all zero, repeat the process: the values differ by 0 at each step, so the next sequence is 0 0 0 0. This means you have enough information to extrapolate the history! Visually, these sequences can be arranged like this:

0   3   6   9  12  15
  3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0

To extrapolate, start by adding a new zero to the end of your list of zeroes; because the zeroes represent differences between the two values above them, this also means there is now a placeholder in every sequence above it:

0   3   6   9  12  15   B
  3   3   3   3   3   A
    0   0   0   0   0

You can then start filling in placeholders from the bottom up. A needs to be the result of increasing 3 (the value to its left) by 0 (the value below it); this means A must be 3:

0   3   6   9  12  15   B
  3   3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0   0

Finally, you can fill in B, which needs to be the result of increasing 15 (the value to its left) by 3 (the value below it), or 18:

0   3   6   9  12  15  18
  3   3   3   3   3   3
    0   0   0   0   0

So, the next value of the first history is 18.

Finding all-zero differences for the second history requires an additional sequence:

1   3   6  10  15  21
  2   3   4   5   6
    1   1   1   1
      0   0   0

Then, following the same process as before, work out the next value in each sequence from the bottom up:

1   3   6  10  15  21  28
  2   3   4   5   6   7
    1   1   1   1   1
      0   0   0   0

So, the next value of the second history is 28.

The third history requires even more sequences, but its next value can be found the same way:

10  13  16  21  30  45  68
   3   3   5   9  15  23
     0   2   4   6   8
       2   2   2   2
         0   0   0

So, the next value of the third history is 68.

If you find the next value for each history in this example and add them together, you get 114.

Analyze your OASIS report and extrapolate the next value for each history. What is the sum of these extrapolated values?

The problem you've described involves a mathematical process known as finite differences, which is a discrete analog of differential calculus. The objective is to determine the next value in a series of numbers by examining the pattern of differences between consecutive numbers. Here's how the problem can be mathematically framed:

    Given Series: You have a series of numbers (e.g., 0 3 6 9 12 15).

    First-Level Differences: Calculate the differences between each pair of consecutive numbers in the series. This creates a new series (e.g., 3 3 3 3 3).

    Subsequent Differences: If the first-level differences are not all zeros, repeat the process on the new series. Continue this process until you get a series where all the differences are zero.

    Backtrack to Find the Next Number: Once you have a series of zeros, you backtrack to find the next number in the original series. You do this by reversing the process:
        Add a zero to the end of the last series of differences.
        Use the differences to find the next number in the preceding series.
        Repeat this process until you reach the original series.

    Summation for Multiple Series: If you have multiple series, you apply this process to each series and then sum the next values you find for each series.

Mathematically, this process uses the principles of sequences and series, specifically arithmetic and geometric progressions in some cases, and more complex polynomial progressions in others. The concept is related to Taylor series in calculus, where a function is approximated by its derivatives at a point. In your problem, instead of continuous functions and derivatives, you're working with discrete sequences and differences.

To solve the problem, you would need to write a program or use a systematic manual calculation for each series of numbers, following the steps outlined above. Let's calculate the sum of the next values for the given series in your problem.

The next values for each of the given series are as follows:

    For the first series (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15), the next value is 18.
    For the second series (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21), the next value is 22.
    For the third series (10, 13, 16, 21, 30, 45), the next value is 47.

Therefore, the sum of these extrapolated values is 18+22+47=8718+22+47=87. ​

your second and third answer for the example series are wrong, here are the correct answers:
Finding all-zero differences for the second history requires an additional sequence:

1   3   6  10  15  21
  2   3   4   5   6
    1   1   1   1
      0   0   0

Then, following the same process as before, work out the next value in each sequence from the bottom up:

1   3   6  10  15  21  28
  2   3   4   5   6   7
    1   1   1   1   1
      0   0   0   0

So, the next value of the second history is 28.

The third history requires even more sequences, but its next value can be found the same way:

10  13  16  21  30  45  68
   3   3   5   9  15  23
     0   2   4   6   8
       2   2   2   2
         0   0   0

So, the next value of the third history is 68.

How could this be implemented most efficiently? Don't answer with concrete code, but describe which approach mathematically and algorithmically would be the most efficient (in rust).

​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To implement this problem efficiently, especially in a language like Rust known for its performance and safety, you would want to focus on both mathematical and algorithmic efficiency. Here’s a general approach:

    Data Structure for Series: Use a dynamic array (like Vec in Rust) to store the series. Dynamic arrays allow efficient access and manipulation of elements.

    Iterative Approach for Difference Calculation:
        Instead of creating new arrays for each level of differences, you can modify the array in place. This reduces memory usage and improves cache performance.
        Iterate through the array, updating each element to be the difference between itself and its previous element.
        Continue this process until all elements are zero, indicating that you've reached a constant difference. This usually means you've reduced the series to a constant or linear function, which is simple to extrapolate.

    Backtracking for Next Value:
        Once you reach an all-zero array, backtrack to find the next value in the series.
        Use a loop to add each level of differences back to the last element of the original series. This can be done in reverse order of the difference calculation.
        This step essentially reconstructs the next value in the series from the constant difference.

    Optimization: Early Termination:
        Implement early termination in your loop if the series reaches an all-zero state before the end. This saves unnecessary computation.
        Additionally, if you detect a pattern (like a constant increase or decrease), you can extrapolate directly without further difference calculation.

    Memory Management:
        Rust’s ownership model helps manage memory efficiently. However, be mindful of unnecessary copying or cloning of the array.
        Use references and borrowing wisely to manipulate the array in place.

    Parallelism (Optional):
        If you're dealing with very large series or multiple series, consider using Rust’s concurrency features.
        Each series can be processed in parallel because they are independent of each other. Rust’s safe concurrency guarantees that this is done without data races.

    Error Handling:
        Rust’s robust error handling via Result and Option types should be used to handle any potential issues, like an empty series or invalid input.

    Efficient Summation:
        Finally, sum up the next values of all series. This step is straightforward and can be done as each series is processed or after all series are processed.

By focusing on in-place updates, early termination, efficient memory management, and parallel processing where applicable, you can create an efficient and robust solution in Rust for this problem.

isn't there a more efficient way to the direct iterative approach?

​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChatGPT

Indeed, there may be a more efficient approach than the direct iterative method, particularly for sequences that follow a predictable pattern such as arithmetic or geometric progressions, or higher-order polynomials. Here's an alternative approach that leverages the mathematical properties of such sequences:

    Identify the Polynomial Degree:
        The key to a more efficient solution lies in recognizing the polynomial degree of the sequence. For instance, if the first set of differences is constant (non-zero), the sequence is arithmetic (linear polynomial). If the second set of differences is constant, the sequence is quadratic, and so on.
        This can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed as you can directly identify the type of polynomial you're dealing with.

    Direct Calculation for Polynomial Sequences:
        For a linear polynomial (arithmetic sequence), the next value is simply the last value plus the common difference.
        For a quadratic polynomial, you can use the formula derived from the sum of the first n natural numbers squared, and similarly for higher degrees.
        This method bypasses the need for iterative difference calculation for sequences that fit these common patterns.

    Fallback to Iterative Method:
        For sequences that do not fit into these common polynomial types, you can fall back to the iterative difference method. This hybrid approach ensures efficiency while maintaining generality.

    Memoization or Caching:
        If the same sequences or types of sequences are encountered repeatedly, using memoization or caching can save previously computed results for faster access.

    Vectorized Operations or SIMD:
        In Rust, you can leverage SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations for vectorized computation. This is especially beneficial for operations like calculating differences or sums over arrays, as it allows multiple data points to be processed in parallel.

    Algorithmic Complexity:
        The direct calculation method for polynomial sequences reduces the algorithmic complexity significantly compared to the iterative method, especially for higher-order polynomials.

By combining these strategies — identifying polynomial degrees, using direct formulas for common patterns, and falling back to iterative methods when necessary — you can create an efficient and optimized solution in Rust. This approach is particularly effective because it minimizes unnecessary computation and leverages mathematical properties to simplify the problem.

how to identify the polynomial degree? how could this be programmed?

​--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChatGPT

Identifying the polynomial degree of a sequence is a key step in optimizing the solution. Here's how you could program this:

    Start with Difference Calculation:
        Begin by calculating the first set of differences between consecutive elements in the sequence.
        Store these differences in a separate array or list.

    Iterate Through Difference Levels:
        Continue calculating the differences of the differences, effectively creating a "difference pyramid."
        With each new level of differences, check if all elements are the same (constant).
        The level at which you find a constant difference indicates the degree of the polynomial:
            First level (first differences are constant) indicates a linear polynomial (arithmetic sequence).
            Second level (second differences are constant) indicates a quadratic polynomial.
            And so on for higher degrees.

    Programming Logic:
        This can be implemented using a loop that iterates through the levels of differences.
        For each level, calculate the new set of differences and check for constancy.
        If a constant set of differences is found, break the loop, as you've identified the polynomial degree.
        You may use a flag or a specific variable to keep track of whether you've found a constant difference set.

    Optimization - Early Termination:
        If at any level, the differences are all zero, you can stop. This indicates that the polynomial degree has been identified.
        Additionally, if the sequence does not form a polynomial of a known type, this approach will reveal that, and you can default to other methods.

    Handling Special Cases:
        Ensure to handle edge cases, such as very short sequences, sequences with all identical elements, or sequences that do not fit a polynomial pattern.

    Example in Pseudocode:

    python

    def identify_polynomial_degree(sequence):
        if len(sequence) < 2:
            return 0  # or appropriate handling for short sequences

        current_diffs = [sequence[i+1] - sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence) - 1)]
        degree = 0

        while len(set(current_diffs)) > 1:
            degree += 1
            current_diffs = [current_diffs[i+1] - current_diffs[i] for i in range(len(current_diffs) - 1)]
            
            if all(diff == 0 for diff in current_diffs):
                break  # Polynomial degree identified

        return degree

    Further Optimization:
        If the sequences follow specific patterns most of the time, you can optimize by checking for these patterns first before falling back to the general method.

This method efficiently identifies the polynomial degree and enables you to use more direct formulas for finding the next value in the sequence, significantly optimizing the overall solution.
